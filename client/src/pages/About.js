                    <p>Welcome to <i>Look-Book</i>, an open space where you can view art from all periods of time, from all
                    groups of people.</p>
                    <p><i>Look-Book</i> is much more than an app for swiping famous pieces of art. Instead, it is a personal
                    journalling application where you are encouraged to reflect on a piece of art that you find appealing.
                    Recent studies have consistently proven the benefit of viewing art and reflecting on its significance to
                    individuals and communities. This is a key function of museums and other cultural institutions.
                    <i>Look-Book</i> makes this function available to you on your mobile device.
